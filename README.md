## Scrapey
is scrape-to-json-in-a-box for node.js

*This is not much more than a proof-of-concept right now. Consider yourself warned.*

If there were to be public keys available, you'd be able to try it at heroku:

Hopefully I'll get around to implementing throttling and that will be available soon...
